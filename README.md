## App Structure (2025 Refactor)

- `src/app/providers/AppProviders.tsx`: Central providers (React Query, Theme, Auth, Tooltips, Toasters)
- `src/app/layouts/RootLayout.tsx`: App shell with `TopNavbar`, `BottomNavbar`, and `Outlet`
- `src/app/router.tsx`: Router with lazy-loaded routes and `ProtectedRoute`
- `src/features/daily/*/components/*Form.tsx`: Daily tracker forms moved under feature folders
- `src/pages/*`: Pages remain; imports updated to use feature forms

Notes:
- Font import moved to `src/main.tsx` (`@fontsource/inter`) to avoid CSS import ordering issues
- `index.css` reorganized; Tailwind layers are loaded after the font import via TS entry
- `TopNavbar` and `BottomNavbar` provide a consistent shell; bottom nav shows on mobile only

## UX Cleanup Highlights

- Unified spacing, shadows, and rounded radii across pages
- Fixed dynamic Tailwind class in `AppDashboard` to avoid invalid class generation
- Improved bottom nav active state with a subtle indicator dot
- Introduced lazy-loaded routes with loading fallbacks to improve perceived performance
- Guarded private routes via `ProtectedRoute`
